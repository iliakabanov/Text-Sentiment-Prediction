# Text-Sentiment-Prediction
In ths task we have to predict text sentiment: whether phone review is positive or negative. 
Steps undertaken:
* Cleaning datasets from wrong untyped lines, lowering words
* Skipping stop words
* Lemmatization
* tf-idf implementation to count weight of each word in a sentence
* word2vec embedding
* hyperparameter tuning through cross-validation
* logistic regression implementation

Conclusion: Obtained results are rather solid, but may be improved with BERT model.
